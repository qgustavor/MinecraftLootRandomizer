# Minecraft 1.14 Loot Table Randomizer

Check it here: https://qgustavor.github.io/MinecraftLootRandomizer/

[Based on SethBling's code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JEXAZOrykQ).

## TODO

- Implement seeding while trying to be compatible with the original code:  
I couldn't find a random implementation that worked the same as Python.
- Allow using other loot_tables.zip
